Ahnii,

Ever struggled with testing your Cobra CLI applications? I recently refactored one of my projects to use dependency injection, and it made testing so much easier. Let me show you how!

## Why Dependency Injection? (2 minutes)

Key benefits for CLI apps:

- Easier to mock dependencies
- More testable code
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Flexible configuration

## Basic Setup (5 minutes)

Here's our basic CLI structure with DI:

```go
type AppDependencies struct {
    Logger  Logger
    Config  Config
    Client  HTTPClient
}

func NewRootCmd(deps *AppDependencies) *cobra.Command {
    cmd := &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "mycli",
        Short: "My CLI application",
        RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
            return runRoot(deps, args)
        },
    }
    return cmd
}
```

## Testing Strategy (10 minutes)

1. **Mock Dependencies**

```go
type MockLogger struct {
    mock.Mock
}

func TestRootCommand(t *testing.T) {
    mockLogger := &MockLogger{}
    deps := &AppDependencies{
        Logger: mockLogger,
    }
    
    cmd := NewRootCmd(deps)
    assert.NotNil(t, cmd)
}
```

2. **Test Command Execution**

```go
func TestCommandExecution(t *testing.T) {
    deps := setupTestDependencies()
    cmd := NewRootCmd(deps)
    
    output, err := executeCommand(cmd, "arg1", "--flag=value")
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Contains(t, output, "expected output")
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep dependencies minimal and focused
- Use interfaces for flexibility
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Mock external services

## Common Patterns

1. **Configuration Injection**

```go
func NewConfig() *Config {
    return &Config{
        // Default values
    }
}
```

2. **Logger Injection**

```go
type Logger interface {
    Info(msg string, args ...interface{})
    Error(msg string, args ...interface{})
}
```

## Wrapping Up

Dependency injection might seem like overhead at first, but it pays off in testability and maintainability. Start small and refactor as needed.
