Ahnii,

Ever had a Docker container fail mysteriously, only to discover it was due to ENTRYPOINT formatting? Let's dive into why JSON arguments are the way to go and how to implement them correctly.

## The Problem (2 minutes)

Shell form can cause unexpected behaviors:

- Signal handling issues
- PID 1 problems
- Variable expansion quirks

## The Solution: JSON Format

Here's the recommended approach:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
CMD ["param3", "param4"]
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Signal Handling**
   - Proper propagation of signals
   - Clean container shutdowns
   - Better process management

2. **Variable Expansion**
   - Predictable behavior
   - No shell interpretation issues
   - Direct executable access

3. **Debugging**
   - Clearer error messages
   - Easier to trace issues
   - Consistent behavior across platforms

## Common Patterns

Here are some real-world examples:

```dockerfile
# Nginx
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# Node.js
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "server.js"]

# Custom script
ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Wrapping Up

Using JSON format for ENTRYPOINT is more than just a recommendation—it's a best practice that can save you from subtle but frustrating issues.
