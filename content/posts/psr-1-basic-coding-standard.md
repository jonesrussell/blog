Ahnii!

Have you ever pulled down a PHP project and felt like you were reading five different coding styles at once? That's exactly what happened to me last week while helping a team with their legacy codebase. Let me show you how PSR-1 can save you from this headache.

## Understanding PSR-1 (5 minutes)

Think of PSR-1 as the "house rules" for PHP code. Just like how every house has basic rules (shoes off at the door, close the fridge, turn off lights), PSR-1 sets the foundation for writing clean PHP code that everyone can understand.

### Files and Namespaces (2 minutes)

Here are the ground rules:

- Only use `<?php` and `<?=` tags (forget about those old-school short tags).
- Always use UTF-8 without BOM (it prevents weird encoding issues).
- Keep your files focused - either declare stuff OR do stuff, not both.

### Naming Things Right (3 minutes)

Let's make it clear:

- Classes use `StudlyCaps` (like `UserManager`, `OrderProcessor`).
- Constants should be in `UPPER_CASE` (like `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `API_VERSION`).
- Methods use `camelCase` (like `getUserById`, `processOrder`).

## Real-World Example (10 minutes)

Here's a practical example from our [repository](https://github.com/jonesrussell/php-fig-guide/blob/main/src/PSR1/UserManager.php):

```php
<?php

namespace JonesRussell\PhpFigGuide\PSR1;

/**
 * User management class following PSR-1 standards.
 *
 * This class provides methods to manage user-related operations, including
 * retrieving user information by ID and defining constants for versioning
 * and error types.
 */
class UserManager
{
    /**
     * Version number of the implementation.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public const VERSION = '1.0.0';

    /**
     * Error type constant for not found errors.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public const ERROR_TYPE_NOT_FOUND = 'not_found';

    /**
     * Get user information by ID.
     *
     * This method retrieves user data based on the provided user ID.
     * It returns an associative array containing the user's ID and name.
     *
     * @param  int $id The user ID to retrieve.
     * @return array User data with 'id' and 'name' keys.
     */
    public function getUserById(int $id): array
    {
        // Implementation
        return ['id' => $id, 'name' => 'John Doe'];
    }
}
```

Let's break down what makes this code PSR-1 compliant:

- Proper namespace using `StudlyCaps`.
- Class name in `StudlyCaps`.
- Constants in `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.
- Method in `camelCase`.

## Common Mistakes and Fixes (5 minutes)

### The Kitchen Sink File

```php
<?php
// Don't do this - mixing declarations and side effects
echo "Hello World";
class Foo {}

// Do this instead - separate files
// config.php
echo "Hello World";

// Foo.php
class Foo {}
```

### Name Things Right

```php
<?php
// Incorrect
class user_manager {}

// Correct
class UserManager {}
```

## Tools to Help You (3 minutes)

I use these tools in all my projects:

- PHP_CodeSniffer: `composer check-style` to spot issues.
- Auto-fixing: `composer fix-style` to fix common mistakes.
- IDE Integration: Let your editor help you stay compliant.
- Git hooks: Catch issues before they hit your repo.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow, we'll explore PSR-3 and see how it makes logging consistent across your applications. This post is part of our [PSR Standards in PHP series](/psr-standards-in-php-practical-guide-for-developers/).
