Ahnii,

Ever struggled to get your AI video generations just right? I've been there. After lots of experimentation, I've found a formula that consistently produces better results. Let's break it down!

## The Formula Structure

Here's the basic formula we'll be working with:

```
Prompt = Subject + Subject Description + Subject Movement + Scene + (Camera Language + Lighting + Atmosphere)
```

## Breaking Down Each Component

### 1. Subject

- The main focus of your video
- Can be people, animals, objects, or anything else
- Forms the foundation of your generation

### 2. Subject Description

Keep it detailed but concise:

- Physical appearance
- Clothing/accessories
- Facial features
- Body posture

### 3. Subject Movement

- Must be suitable for a 5-second video
- Be specific about motion or stillness
- Keep it straightforward

### 4. Scene

- Define the environment
- Include foreground and background elements
- Keep it focused and relevant

### 5. Technical Elements (Optional)

- **Camera Language**: Specify shots (wide-angle, close-up, etc.)
- **Lighting**: Define the mood through light
- **Atmosphere**: Set the overall tone

## Example Prompt

Here's how it comes together:

```
A TIE Fighter made from cereal pieces. The TIE Fighter is detailed with the cereal pieces clearly visible, flying through space. The scene is set against a starry background. Add the classic TIE Fighter sound effect to enhance the atmosphere.
```

## Wrapping Up

Remember, the best prompts are clear, specific, and focused. Start with this formula and adjust based on your needs and results.
