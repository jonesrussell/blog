Ahnii,

Ever wanted to build your own AI chatbot but found the JavaScript examples a bit... meh? Me too! That's why I decided to create one using Go. In this series, I'll walk you through building a chatbot that's both powerful and maintainable.

## Why Go for AI?

Here's why Go makes sense for AI applications:

- Strong concurrency support
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Clear error handling
- Built-in testing framework
- Simple deployment options

## Project Setup (5 minutes)

First, let's set up our project structure:

```go
project/
├── cmd/
│   └── bot/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── chat/
│   │   └── chat.go
│   └── config/
│       └── config.go
└── go.mod
```

## Core Components

### 1. Configuration

We'll use environment variables for flexible configuration:

```go
type Config struct {
    APIKey     string
    ModelName  string
    MaxTokens  int
}
```

### 2. Chat Handler

Our chat handler will manage conversations:

```go
type ChatHandler struct {
    client  *anthropic.Client
    config  *config.Config
}
```

## What's Next?

In the upcoming posts, we'll:

- Implement the chat logic
- Add conversation memory
- Handle different types of messages
- Add error recovery
- Deploy our bot

## Wrapping Up

This is just the beginning of our Go-powered AI chatbot journey. The foundation we've laid here will support more advanced features as we progress.
