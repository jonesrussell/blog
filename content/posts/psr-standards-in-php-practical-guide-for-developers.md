Are you tired of wrestling with inconsistent PHP codebases or struggling to make different packages work together? You're not alone! In this series, we'll explore how PHP-FIG's PSR standards can transform your development experience.

## What is PHP-FIG?

PHP-FIG is a group of PHP project representatives working together to advance the PHP ecosystem. Their primary contribution is the PSR system, which defines coding standards and interfaces that enable better interoperability between PHP packages and frameworks.

## Why PSRs Matter

PSRs solve several critical challenges in PHP development:

- Code Consistency: Standardized coding styles make code more readable
- Interoperability: Common interfaces allow different packages to work together seamlessly
- Best Practices: Established patterns improve code quality and maintainability

## Series Overview

## Practical Learning

Each post will include:

- Detailed explanation of the standard
- Practical implementation examples
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Integration with popular frameworks

## Getting Started

To follow along with this series:

1. Clone our companion repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonesrussell/php-fig-guide.git
cd php-fig-guide
composer install
```

2. Each PSR implementation has its own:
   - Directory under `src/`
   - Complete working examples
   - Tests to verify compliance
   - Tagged release (e.g., v0.1.0 for PSR-1)

3. Use the provided Composer scripts:

```bash
# Check coding standards
composer check-style

# Fix coding standards automatically
composer fix-style
```
