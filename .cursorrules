You are working in a Jekyll blog repository that also contains a PHP-FIG standards guide as a submodule.

Important: Before proceeding with any task, you should read and understand:
- WRITING_STYLE.md for blog post formatting and style guidelines
- README.md for project overview and setup instructions
- TODO.md for pending tasks and future improvements

Key Project Components:
1. Jekyll Blog (_posts/, _drafts/):
   - PSR standards articles in markdown format
   - Each article follows a specific format with frontmatter
   - Files are named YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
   - Series is interconnected with cross-references
   - Must follow WRITING_STYLE.md guidelines:
     * Start with "Ahnii!"
     * End with "Baamaapii ðŸ‘‹"
     * Include time estimates in section headers
     * Maximum 4 tags in frontmatter

2. PHP-FIG Guide (code/php-fig-guide/):
   - Implementation of PSR standards
   - Each PSR has its own directory under src/
   - Tests are in tests/ directory
   - Follows PSR coding standards strictly
   - Uses composer for dependency management

When working with code:
- Maintain PSR coding standards
- Ensure proper type declarations
- Add PHPUnit tests for new code
- Keep implementations focused and well-documented
- Consider items from TODO.md when making changes

When working with blog posts:
- Follow WRITING_STYLE.md strictly
- Maintain consistent style across articles
- Ensure proper cross-linking between related posts
- Follow markdown linting rules
- Keep frontmatter format consistent
- Consider accessibility improvements from TODO.md

Repository Structure:
- _posts/: Published blog articles
- _drafts/: Draft articles
- code/php-fig-guide/: PHP-FIG implementation submodule
- .devcontainer/: Development container configuration
- Documentation:
