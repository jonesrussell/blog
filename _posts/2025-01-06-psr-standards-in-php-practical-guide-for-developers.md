Are you tired of wrestling with inconsistent PHP codebases or struggling to make different packages work together? You're not alone! In this series, we'll explore how PHP-FIG's PSR standards can transform your development experience.

## What is PHP-FIG?

PHP-FIG is a group of PHP project representatives working together to advance the PHP ecosystem. Their primary contribution is the PSR system, which defines coding standards and interfaces that enable better interoperability between PHP packages and frameworks.

## Why PSRs Matter

PSRs solve several critical challenges in PHP development:

- Code Consistency: Standardized coding styles make code more readable
- Interoperability: Common interfaces allow different packages to work together seamlessly
- Best Practices: Established patterns improve code quality and maintainability

## Series Overview

This series will cover all accepted PSRs in detail:

- PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard
- PSR-3: Logger Interface
- PSR-4: Autoloading Standard
