<h4>Docker Images as ‘Native’ Commands</h4>
<p>
  Ahnee! If you’re from the Mac World you’ve probably used, or at least heard of,
  <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. For the uninformed, Homebrew is
  <em>The missing package manager for macOS. </em>Or more accurately it’s a package management system for macOS that’s
  comparable to Redhat’s <a href="http://rpm.org/">RPM</a>, Debian’s <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Apt">APT</a>, and
  Window’s <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Package managers make installing software easy by automagically fetching a pre-compiled binary and its dependencies,
  then copying them into your $PATH.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on the software, compiling from source code is often difficult and time-consuming. Package managers let you
  get on with the using the software.
</p>
<h3>Installing With APT</h3>

<p>I’ll demonstrate installing a package with APT in Ubuntu 18.10:</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> sudo apt install figlet</pre>
<p>
  As you can see in the screenshot, APT downloads the figlet package (figlet_2.2.5–3_amd64.deb), unpacks it, then
  finally installs to /usr/bin/figlet.
</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> figlet &quot;p4ck4g3&#39;s 4 l1fe\!&quot;</pre>

<h3>I Whale Always Love You</h3>
<p>
  Whalebrew is an inevitable side effect of container proliferation. Their ease of use, speed, and low resource
  consumption make them ideal vehicles for single command or function execution.
</p>
<p>
  As I’ve
  <a href="https://medium.com/@jonesrussell42/docker-for-legacy-drupal-development-6df4dec8b309#b965"
    >previously written</a
  >, containers can be started, perform a task, then stopped in a matter of milliseconds. And that’s exactly what
  Whalebrew allows you to do in the form of Docker images aliased in your $PATH.
</p>
<p>Now let’s put a magnifying glass up to Whalebrew by walking through its installation then “install a package”.</p>
<h3>Whalebrew Demonstration</h3>
<p>
  By creating an alias for running a Docker container and storing it in $PATH, running a command within a container is
  seamless and virtually indistinguishable from running a command directly in the environment.
</p>
<p>
  What does that look like exactly? Assuming you already have
  <a href="https://medium.com/@jonesrussell42/docker-for-legacy-drupal-development-6df4dec8b309#db40"
    >Docker installed</a
  >, we’ll start by installing Whalebrew (from
  <a href="https://github.com/bfirsh/whalebrew">https://github.com/bfirsh/whalebrew</a>):
</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> sudo curl -L &quot;https://github.com/bfirsh/whalebrew/releases/download/0.1.0/whalebrew-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)&quot; -o /usr/local/bin/whalebrew; sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/whalebrew</pre>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/734/1*EzjhwX8SPJ-Zlcjxiayt2A.png" />
  <figcaption>Whalebrew installed to /usr/local/bin/whalebrew</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now let’s install figlet again, but this time with Whalebrew:</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> sudo whalebrew install whalebrew/figlet</pre>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/734/1*bLCbFgBYsdCcLfeKnr2UpA.png" />
  <figcaption>whalebrew/figlet installed to /usr/local/bin/figlet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Now let’s run figlet again and adore the glorious results (We’ll use the full path in case the APT figlet is first
  in $PATH):
</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> /usr/local/bin/figlet &quot;It&#39;s a whale of a time\!&quot;</pre>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/734/1*X8Eew1wrMcMjbw2-skNPGQ.png" />
  <figcaption>figlet as run in a Docker container</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Tada! We’ve just run figlet from within a container. You may have noticed it took a bit longer to execute, depending
  on your computer’s <em>runtime juice</em>.
</p>
<p>
  So what just happened? Before we wrap it up we’ll take a quick look under the hood and examine the difference between
  running a native binary and a Whalebrew command.
</p>
<h3>Native vs. ‘Native’</h3>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
  Maazhichige, wrong ‘native’! The figlet program installed with APT is an ELF executable, the
  <a href="https://github.com/cmatsuoka/figlet">source code</a> compiled from C, and it runs directly on your system.
</p>
<p>The Whalebrew alias looks like this:</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> cat /usr/local/bin/figlet</pre>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/734/1*zMYeFQLlnwjjhttXCnVGiw.png" /></figure>
<blockquote>
  When a package is executed, Whalebrew will run the specified image with Docker, mount the current working directory in
  /workdir, and pass through all of the arguments.
</blockquote>
<p>And this is essentially what Whalebrew executes:</p>
<pre><strong>$</strong> docker run -it -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:/workdir -w /workdir whalebrew/figlet &quot;It&#39;s a whale of a time\!&quot;</pre>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/734/1*lSmdCGIGlEE6KDWGBHfFMA.png" /></figure>
<p>And well, that’s it, move along. Baamaapii.</p>
