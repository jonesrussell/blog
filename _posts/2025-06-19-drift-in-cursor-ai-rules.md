# Drift in Cursor AI Rules

Ahnii! As codebases evolve, Cursor AI rules quietly fall behind. Rules that once provided helpful suggestions now generate irrelevant completions. Patterns that worked for your initial architecture become counterproductive as your project grows. This is drift—and it's undermining your AI-assisted development workflow.

## Problem

Drift happens because we treat Cursor rules as set-and-forget configurations. But they're not static—they're living instructions that must evolve with our code. When they don't, the AI starts offering suggestions that feel more like obstacles than assistance.

The cost compounds over time: ignoring unhelpful completions, fighting against outdated patterns, and ultimately, losing trust in AI-powered development tools.

## Example

Your project moved from JavaScript to TypeScript, but your Cursor rules still generate untyped code.

**Outdated `/cursor/.rules`:**

```markdown
# Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with useState hooks
- Export default components
- Use PropTypes for validation

const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};
```

**Updated rules:**

```markdown
# Component Guidelines  
- Use TypeScript functional components
- Define proper interfaces for props
- Export default components

interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};
```

The AI now suggests properly typed components instead of outdated JavaScript patterns.

## Solution

Treat your Cursor rules like code. They need active maintenance, not neglect.

**Audit your rules, all the time.** Which ones generate irrelevant suggestions? What new patterns aren't captured?

**Usage monitoring**: Pay attention to which AI suggestions you consistently reject or modify. These are signals of drift.

**Incremental updates**: Refine rules based on how your codebase actually evolves, not how you thought it would.

**Team alignment**: Ensure rules reflect current team practices and architectural decisions.

## Payoff

When you prevent drift, Cursor transforms from a sometimes-helpful tool into a reliable coding partner. The AI understands your current patterns and provides genuinely useful suggestions that accelerate development.

Maintaining alignment between your rules and reality ensures that AI assistance enhances rather than interrupts your flow. In a world where AI coding tools are becoming essential, keeping them accurate and relevant isn't optional—it's critical for productivity.

Baamaapii!
