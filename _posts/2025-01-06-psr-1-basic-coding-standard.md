Ahnii!

Have you ever pulled down a PHP project and felt like you were reading five different coding styles at once? ðŸ¤” That's exactly what happened to me last week while helping a team with their legacy codebase. Let me show you how PSR-1 can save you from this headache!

## Understanding PSR-1 (5 minutes)

Think of PSR-1 as the "house rules" for PHP code. Just like how every house has basic rules (shoes off at the door, close the fridge, turn off lights), PSR-1 sets the foundation for writing clean PHP code that everyone can understand.

### 1. Files and Namespaces (2 minutes)

Here are the ground rules:
- Only use `<?php` and `<?=` tags (forget about those old-school short tags!)
- Always use UTF-8 without BOM (trust me, it prevents weird encoding issues)
- Keep your files focused - either declare stuff OR do stuff, not both (like how you wouldn't cook and do laundry in the same room)

### 2. Naming Things Right (3 minutes)

Let's make it crystal clear:
- Classes use `StudlyCaps` (like `UserManager`, `OrderProcessor`)
- Constants should SHOUT_AT_YOU (like `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `API_VERSION`)
- Methods speak `camelCase` (like `getUserById`, `processOrder`)

## Real-World Example (10 minutes)

Here's a practical example from our [repository](https://github.com/jonesrussell/php-fig-guide/blob/main/src/PSR1/UserManager.php):

```php
<?php

namespace JonesRussell\PhpFigGuide\PSR1;

class UserManager
{
    const VERSION = '1.0.0';
    const ERROR_TYPE_NOT_FOUND = 'not_found';

    public function getUserById($id)
    {
        // Implementation
        return ['id' => $id, 'name' => 'John Doe'];
    }
}
```

Let's break down what makes this code PSR-1 compliant:
- âœ… Proper namespace using `StudlyCaps`
- âœ… Class name in `StudlyCaps`
- âœ… Constants in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
- âœ… Method in `camelCase`

## Common Mistakes and Fixes (5 minutes)

1. ðŸš« **The Kitchen Sink File**
   ```php
   <?php
   // Don't do this - mixing declarations and side effects
   echo "Hello World";
   class Foo {}

   // Do this instead - separate files
   // config.php
   echo "Hello World";
   
   // Foo.php
   class Foo {}
   ```

2. ðŸŽ¯ **Name Things Right**
   ```php
   <?php
   // Please no!
   class user_manager {}
   
   // Much better!
   class UserManager {}
   ```

## Tools to Help You (3 minutes)

I use these tools in all my projects:
- PHP_CodeSniffer: `composer check-style` to spot issues
- Auto-fixing: `composer fix-style` to fix common mistakes
- IDE Integration: Let your editor help you stay compliant
- Git hooks: Catch issues before they hit your repo

## Next Steps

Tomorrow, we'll explore PSR-3 and see how it makes logging consistent across your applications. This post is part of our [PSR Standards in PHP series](/blog/psr-standards-in-php-practical-guide-for-developers).
