Ahnii! I previously wrote a command line utility named '[packages](./quickly-view-project-dependencies-on-the-cli.md)' which simply prints a list of project dependencies on the command line.

I also found that I often want to see a list of scripts in package.json too, so I wrote another utility I've named 'scripts'.

Check it out at [https://github.com/jonesrussell/scripts](https://github.com/jonesrussell/scripts) or simply:

```sh
npm i -g @jonesrussell42/scripts
```

Meegwetch!
