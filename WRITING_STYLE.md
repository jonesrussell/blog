## Language and Style

### Writing Concisely
- Avoid unnecessary adjectives like "comprehensive", "complete", "full", "robust", etc.
- Remove words that don't add value (very, really, basically, actually)
- Use active voice instead of passive
- Get to the point quickly
- If a word doesn't change the meaning when removed, remove it

### Examples
‚ùå Don't:
- "A comprehensive guide to PHP-FIG standards"
- "A complete tutorial that fully explains..."
- "A really useful tool that actually helps..."

‚úÖ Do:
- "A guide to PHP-FIG standards"
- "A tutorial explaining..."
- "A tool that helps..."
