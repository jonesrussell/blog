# Blog Reviewing

## Overview

Systematically audit blog posts against the canonical style rules defined in the blog-writing skill. Every review follows the same checklist — no ad-hoc exploration.

**Canonical authority:** The style rules in `.claude/skills/blog-writing/SKILL.md` and `docs/blog-style.md` are the source of truth. Read both before reviewing. Reference post: `content/posts/laravel-boost-ddev.md`.

## Review Process

1. Read the blog-writing skill and `docs/blog-style.md` to load current rules
2. Identify the post type (series or general) from frontmatter `series` field
3. Run through the checklist below in order
4. Report findings using the standard format

## Checklist

Run every check. Do not skip items.

### Frontmatter

- [ ] `title` present, sentence case, descriptive
- [ ] `date` in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] `categories` present, lowercase, hyphenated for multi-word
- [ ] `tags` present, **max 4**
- [ ] `summary` field used (not `description`). One sentence: outcome or audience.
- [ ] `slug` present, kebab-case
- [ ] `draft` field present
- [ ] **Series posts only:** `series` field present with correct series name

### Structure

- [ ] Opens with "Ahnii!" (exclamation mark, own paragraph)
- [ ] Closes with "Baamaapii" (no emoji, own paragraph)
- [ ] Intro states what the post covers in one sentence (scoped)
- [ ] No "Wrapping Up" or "Conclusion" heading
- [ ] No time estimates in section headings
- [ ] Heading hierarchy: H2 for main sections, H3 for variants/subsections
- [ ] Prerequisites section (bullet list) when relevant

### Series Post Structure (only if `series` field exists)

- [ ] Prerequisites blockquote after greeting
- [ ] Problem statement section
- [ ] Core concepts/interfaces section with code
- [ ] Real-world implementation section
- [ ] Common mistakes section with bad/good code pairs
- [ ] Framework integration section
- [ ] Try it yourself section with companion repo commands
- [ ] What's next section linking to next post in series

### Content

- [ ] All code blocks have language tags
- [ ] After each code block: 1-2 sentences explaining what it does or why
- [ ] First mention of products/tools/projects is linked
- [ ] Internal links use root-relative format with trailing slash: `/slug/`
- [ ] External links use full HTTPS URLs
- [ ] Voice is second person, direct, instructional ("you"/"your", not "I"/"my")
- [ ] Concise: short sentences, one idea per paragraph, no filler

## Findings Format

Report each finding as:

```
**[CATEGORY]** Line N: description
  Fix: exact correction
```

**Categories:**
- **MISSING** — Required element is absent
- **INCORRECT** — Element exists but violates a rule
- **SUGGESTION** — Not a rule violation, but would improve the post

Always include the line number and a specific fix. Do not report findings without both.

**Example:**
```
**MISSING** Line 50: No farewell. Post ends without "Baamaapii"
  Fix: Add "Baamaapii" as the final line, on its own paragraph

**INCORRECT** Line 13: Greeting uses comma ("Ahnii,") instead of exclamation mark
  Fix: Change "Ahnii," to "Ahnii!"

**INCORRECT** Line 102: Farewell has emoji ("Baamaapii 👋")
  Fix: Change to "Baamaapii" — no emoji
```

## Batch Mode

When asked to review multiple posts:

1. List all target posts (e.g., all drafts: `grep -l "draft: true" content/posts/*.md`)
2. Identify each post's type (series vs general)
3. Review each post against the checklist
4. Group findings by post with a summary count

**Output format for batch:**
```
## [post-slug.md] — [N findings: X missing, Y incorrect, Z suggestions]
[findings]

## [post-slug.md] — [N findings: ...]
[findings]
```
