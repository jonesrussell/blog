# Building an AI Chatbot with Go: Part 1 - The Foundation

Ahnii,

Ever wanted to build your own AI chatbot but found the JavaScript examples a bit... meh? Me too! That's why I decided to create one using Go. In this series, I'll walk you through building a chatbot that's both powerful and maintainable.

## Why Go for AI?

Here's why Go makes sense for AI applications:
- Strong concurrency support
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Clear error handling
- Built-in testing framework
- Simple deployment options

## Project Setup (5 minutes)

First, let's set up our project structure:

```go
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bot/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chat/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chat.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ config.go
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

## Core Components

### 1. Configuration
We'll use environment variables for flexible configuration:

```go
type Config struct {
    APIKey     string
    ModelName  string
    MaxTokens  int
}
```

### 2. Chat Handler
Our chat handler will manage conversations:

```go
type ChatHandler struct {
    client  *anthropic.Client
    config  *config.Config
}
```

## What's Next?

In the upcoming posts, we'll:
- Implement the chat logic
- Add conversation memory
- Handle different types of messages
- Add error recovery
- Deploy our bot

## Wrapping Up

This is just the beginning of our Go-powered AI chatbot journey. The foundation we've laid here will support more advanced features as we progress.
