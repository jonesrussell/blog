> Note: Both this blog post and my blog's [style guide documentation](https://github.com/jonesrussell/blog/blob/v1.0.0/WRITING_STYLE.md) were entirely generated through AI analysis of patterns found in my existing blog posts. The "Ahnii" greeting and "Baamaapii" farewell, for example, were identified as consistent patterns across posts.

Ahnii,

Ever notice how your favorite bloggers have that distinct "voice" that makes their posts instantly recognizable? I recently realized I had developed my own style over time, but it wasn't documented anywhere. Here's how I turned that realization into action.

## The Lightbulb Moment

While working on recent posts about golangci-lint and AI prompt formulas, it hit me: I've been unconsciously following certain patterns in my writing. I use specific greetings, maintain a particular tone, and structure my posts in a consistent way. But without documentation, this style lived only in my head.

## AI-Assisted Style Analysis

Instead of trying to decode my own style (which can be surprisingly hard!), I had an idea: why not ask AI to analyze my existing posts? I pointed Claude at my dev.to profile (dev.to/jonesrussell) and asked it to draft a description of my writing style.

The result was fascinating - patterns I hadn't consciously noticed emerged:

- My consistent use of "Ahnii" as a greeting
- A focus on 1-3 minute read lengths
- Regular use of clear headings and bullet points
- A pattern of ending posts with engagement prompts

## The Living Style Guide

The analysis turned into [WRITING_STYLE.md](https://github.com/jonesrussell/blog/blob/main/WRITING_STYLE.md) in my blog's repository. It's a living document that currently outlines five key elements:

1. Friendly, Conversational Tone
2. Concise & Practical Content
3. Clear Structure
4. Tutorial-Friendly Format
5. Engagement Elements

## Bootstrap Moment

Here's where it gets meta - I'm writing this very post following the style guide that it's describing! It's like a snake eating its own tail, but in a good way. ðŸ˜„

## The Road Ahead

This style guide isn't meant to be static. As my writing evolves, so will the document. I'm keeping it in my blog's main repository where it can:

- Serve as a reference for my future posts
- Help maintain consistency
- Evolve with my writing style
- Potentially help other bloggers develop their own guides

## What's Next?

Having a documented style guide opens up some interesting possibilities:

- Creating templates for different types of posts
- Building automated checks for style consistency
- Collaborating with others while maintaining a consistent voice

What do you think about documenting writing styles? Do you have your own style guide, or are you thinking about creating one? Let's discuss in the comments!

P.S. You can always find the latest version of my style guide in my blog's repository. It's a work in progress, just like my writing journey!
