Ahnii! No. I don't think Bash is dumb, I think Zsh is better.

And this post is part of my new mashup of pop-culture and Linux tips, or #PopCultureLinuxTipMashup if you're (jiggy witt it)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JcmQONgXJM] and/or #livin-that-hash-tag-life-yall.



I figure it's a good barometer for how stale the tip is based on the reference.
