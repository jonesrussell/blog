Ahnii!!

This is how I use Drupal to publish content to different frameworks and platforms. On a macro level this is essentially an Event system within core architecture and between any projects.

What an age we live in!

I like to use a [Redis](https://redis.io/) Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) channel, message or event, which can then be picked up by any Content Subscriber such as Laravel, NodeJS, so on and so forth.

For the purpose of this post you must have a working Drupal project.

## Requirements

* Drupal 8 || Drupal 9
* Redis 
* [Redis Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/redis)

## Install Drupal

foo

## Add Redis

foo
